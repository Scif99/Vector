I implemented a vector class mimicking the std::vector class from the std library. I did this hoping that it would help me understand some of the lower-level functions
in C++, as well as the design decisions made along the way. The code is mostly based on that from the book "The C++ Programming Language"

TO-DO
- Implement iterators
- 
- 'copy-and-swap'
